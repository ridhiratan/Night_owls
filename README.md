## Theme: Covid19
## Problem Statement
On an average, a person spends around an hour searching for desired products in markets. In trying times of Covid19, we do not want to spend unnecessary time wandering in markets as it exposes us to the risk of catching the virus. 

## Proposed Solution -- Shoplocal
To connect local shops with their needed customers, we are building a web-app wherein, these local small scale shopkeepers would be able to update the app with what they have to sell and this information would make their commodities available to the local people. So, majorly this is a web app where we are trying to promote local shopkeepers and their products who have thrived to find customers and were widely affected.

## Instructions to run the project
1. Clone the repository.
2. Its is preferred to run the project in xampp. Get your xampp running and create a database in phpmyadmin named `shoplocal`. Import `/database/shoplocal.sql` to build the tables.
3. Cut/Copy paste the repository folder in `xampp/htdocs`.
4. You can view the web application at [localhost/Night_owls/](http://localhost/Night_owls/).
